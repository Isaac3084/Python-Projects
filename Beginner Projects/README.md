- All projects are written in **pure Python** and require no external libraries.

### Goals:
- Get comfortable with Python syntax and structure.
- Practice problem-solving and logical thinking through hands-on coding.

Feel free to explore, modify, and build upon these projects to deepen your understanding of Python!

Happy Learning! 🎉
